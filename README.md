# HiveMind: Collaborative AI Chat Platform

HiveMind is a real-time collaborative chat platform that enables teams to brainstorm and develop ideas together with the help of AI. Each user can connect with their own API key, ensuring privacy and control over their AI usage.

## 🧠 Join the Brainstorm

I'm building HiveMind step-by-step in public — and you’re invited to be part of it.

If you want to help me brainstorm, shape ideas, or just see exactly where I'm at in the process,

Every insight, idea, or contribution helps move HiveMind forward.  
Let's build something incredible together. 🚀

📚 **New Here? Start by Asking:**  
Not sure where to start? Try asking HiveMind simple questions like:
- "What is HiveMind and how does it work?"
- "How can I use HiveMind to brainstorm or collaborate?"

These questions will give you a quick feel for what HiveMind is about and how it can supercharge your projects, brainstorms, and team sessions.

🛠️ **A Quick Note:**  
HiveMind is still in its early stages — it's a big, happy vision with some framework already hooked up, but it needs a lot of building and refining to reach its full potential.

If you're someone who knows how to code, or even just someone who believes in the idea and wants to help (through promoting it, sharing it, or even offering ideas), you're more than welcome to jump in.

✅ **Next Steps:**
- Ask HiveMind (the chat) how you can help.
- It might be coding, it might be brainstorming, it might be spreading the word — every little bit moves us closer to building something great together.
